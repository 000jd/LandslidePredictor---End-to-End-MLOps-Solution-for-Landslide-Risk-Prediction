# LandslidePredictor---End-to-End-MLOps-Solution-for-Landslide-Risk-Prediction
LandslidePredML - MLOps for Landslide Prediction This project builds a machine learning model to predict landslides using synthetic data. It includes an MLOps pipeline with ZenML, EDA in Jupyter notebooks, and a Streamlit app for deployment, using features like terrain, rainfall, and soil properties.
